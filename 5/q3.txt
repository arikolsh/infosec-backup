I implented in the stack addresses of the following instructions: 
<the return address from check-password function>
mov [A], B; ret;
int B; ret; <= here eax will hold 1
xor B,B; ret;
<the address of the global variable auth>
pop A; ret; 
buf[n-1]
...
buf[0]

A and B are suitable registers I found using the search module
