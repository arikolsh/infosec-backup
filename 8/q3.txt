first we find the packets that are designated for our default gateway.
we do this by checking the mac address of the packet with the default mac and we check the src ip is not ours.
afterwards we make a spoof arp response, there we impersonate the destination ip of the arp query at the ip layer but we give our actual mac address. so now the sender who made the arp query maps that ip to our mac address.
