we use a /join message. this creates a new channel and with it a new link in the menu on the left of the site. we implant a js script with '<script>...</script>' as the name of the new channel, which will cause the browser to render it and execute it on load. in the script i used the postmessage() (which is in the code.js file) function with the messsage "good morning" and the channel "spam" hard coded.
