in q5 i took advantage of the fact that the verification process take so much time. run.py opens the script file two times. first for taking the contents and running the verify and second time to retreive the command to execute. after the first time run.py opens the file we will change the command in the file to 'echo hacked' using a thread, that way the second time after the verification will be done run.py will effectively execute 'echo hacked'. additional comments in the code
